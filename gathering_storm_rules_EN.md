# THE GAME

**GATHERING STORM**
1–6 players | A deck of cards | A coin | A piece of paper | Writing implements | An hour or so

**Take turns to read this text out loud.** The player whose birthday is nearest the start of the year can go first. At each **TITLE**, change reader.

In this game we will tell a story of a newly liberated land, a land coming to terms with its past and trying to form something new. The Authority has left, but they’ve left us with this alien fruit, many bad memories, and a hundred things unsaid.

---

# SAFETY

This is a game that can involve material around colonialism and trauma, so should be played with care for all involved. Place your **coin** on the table, **heads-side up**. If anyone is ever uncomfortable with what is being discussed, **turn the coin over** for the group to change subject.

---

# TRUTHS

Now we will create our setting, the place where our story will take place and where we live. The following things are **true** about our community:

*   We fought for our freedom, but memories of the time before are still raw.
*   The galaxy outside is hostile and treacherous.
*   The alien power, the Authority, is gone, but still has a hold. People, industries and memories still remain. Processing their alien fruit is our main employment and source of trade.

These truths can be threatened over the course of play.

---

# UNCOVERING

This is a game of uncovering a world together.

Together we will **create a map** and a story. We will **build up the map** as we play. Each player will **add something new** to each place. Eventually we will know more about this place, and we will seek to know the community that lives here.

This story is based on a real place and real events, but we will imagine another planet, and a particular place on that planet where all the characters now live.

# SETTING

## OUR LAND

First we’ll describe a far-away world. We’ll take a few minutes to choose or invent five aspects of the local environment, while we **draw them** on our piece of paper, starting our **Map**. What does our land look like? What are the main features?

*Red dust landscape, twin moons, low mist, shimmering haze, jagged rock, rolling fields, verdant crops, bioluminescent moss, deep jungle, angular craft, drifting clouds, blazing sun, cool breeze, rolling rivers, wind turbines, smooth forms, curved chrome, orange sky, smoking vents, cool streams, vivid flowers, churned-up tracks, crystal growths, sprawling roots, quiet ruins, murky swamp, heavy heat, cool breeze, canopy, intense scent, birdsong, silence, dappled light, heavy rain, teeming with life, deserted, sweet odour, quietude, wilds, fluorescent lighting, grasping vines, multichromatic haze, strange critters, large beasts*

## SETTLEMENT

Now we’ll **draw a settlement** somewhere suitable in the middle of the map. As we draw, we’ll give the settlement a **name**. What does it look like?

*spherical dwellings, cuboid forms, fractal architecture, clean lines, organic forms, elevated homes, dusty bioshells, holograms, crystal structures, smooth stone, modular buildings, vine-covered, blazing lights, subtle glow, grown from the earth, built of metal, deep caves*

## WHO WE ARE

Now let’s take a few minutes to choose or invent three aspects of **who we are**.
What do we look like? What do we do together? How do we live together?

*large, small, hairy, smooth, reptilian, mammalian, vegetal, fungal, amphibian, lithe, ponderous, loud, quiet, eating, drinking, dancing, signing, playing, fighting, debating, painting, looking, reading, cooking, building, writing, storytelling, burrowing, bathing*

## OUR AREA

We’ll take turns to **draw and describe** three more sites.

*Dark Forest, Winding River, Verdant Highlands, Hermitage Shack, Rebel Base, Cursed Place, Fathomless Caves, Scorched Lands, Great Mountains, Deserted homesteads*

Does anyone live in these places? If so, we’ll **note their name** at the location.

---

# THE AUTHORITY

Now let’s choose or invent three aspects of the Authority, the alien power that has recently left. What do they look like? What did they do together? What did they do to maintain control before they were forced to leave? We’ll **draw their Abandoned Headquarters** on the map as we describe the Authority.

*large, small, hairy, smooth, reptilian, mammalian, vegetal, fungal, amphibian, lithe, ponderous, loud, quiet, eating, drinking, dancing, signing, playing, fighting, debating, painting, looking, reading, cooking, building, writing, storytelling, burrowing, bathing*

## THE AUTHORITY’S INFLUENCE

The Authority still has an influence on some of our places. We’ll **draw the Authority’s remaining sites** on the Map: the **Colonial Farmstead**, the **Industrial Cannery**.

## REMNANTS OF THE AUTHORITY

What has the Authority left behind? We’ll **draw some features** on the Map.

*strange creature, intricate flower, deserted camp, something hidden, something forgotten, stacks of cans, machinery, packed containers, uniforms, rotting fruit, vast hangars, maze of boxes, piles of papers, abandoned complex, wreckage, tubs of poison, agricultural machinery, tattered tarps, someone’s diary, mould and spores, web-covered furniture, photographs in cracked frames, moss and lichen, inscrutable technology, empty storerooms, wardrobe of clothes, burnt documents, abandoned outposts, defunct Authority branding, canned alien fruit, wrecked spaceships, rusted bolts, vats of poisons, clunky machines*

---

# ALIEN FRUIT

The economy revolves around an alien foodstuff, grown for profit and export. This plant was introduced by the Authority, and requires the use of toxins to survive.

Let’s choose or invent three aspects of this **alien fruit**. How did this fruit change the land? How did this fruit change you? We’ll **draw the fruit**, and then **draw the Vast Plantation** on the Map.

*Sweet, sour, nourishing, aromatic, addictive, psychotropic, stinky, juicy, sharp, smooth, delicious, pungent, deadly, restorative, substantial, succulent, buttery, luscious, fleshy, gourd-like, berry, bean, plump, shriveled, creamy, fragrant, moist, pulpy, seeded, tangy*

# THE CARDS

## CHARACTERS & SECRETS

Now we take a pack of cards. **Separate them** into:
1.  **Characters** (Jacks, Queens, Kings)
2.  **Secrets** (Hearts A–10, with the two Jokers)
3.  **Oracle** (The remaining cards), removing the **Ace of Spades**.

**Shuffle** all three decks separately, and **shuffle the Ace of Spades** into the second half of the Oracle. **Deal the character cards** out, one each to each player, and place the rest face up on the map at suitable locations. **Deal out a secret**, face down, to each character. Consult the **Character Table** and the **Secrets Table** for your own character.

**Take it in turns to introduce your characters** and the characters on the map. What is their name and appearance? What do people say about this Person?

Also think about how your secret affects your character, but **keep it private** from the group. Keep the map characters’ secrets hidden, and place them under their character card.

## THE ORACLE

**Take it in turns to take a card** from the Oracle and consult the **Oracle Table**. **Read the event.** **Describe the action** and **draw something** to represent the event on the map. Once completed, play passes to the left.

It is close to the celebration of independence. When the **Ace of Spades** is drawn the day arrives, and everyone gathers at the Settlement to celebrate.
